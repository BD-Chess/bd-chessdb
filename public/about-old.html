  <h1>Welcome to the ChessBest Interface</h1>

  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>Play, Review, Learn</h3>
    <p>
      The ChessBest interface helps you review famous games or analyze your own. It’s fast, clear, and packed with insight from the powerful ChessDB engine database.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>Yellow Dots: See the Next Move</h3>
    <p>
      When you're reviewing a game and you're not on the last move, the next move is shown with two yellow dots:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One dot marks the piece that will move</li>
      <li>One dot shows where it will go</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This lets you preview the next move and understand how the game unfolds.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>Evaluation Badges: Understand the Options</h3>
    <p>
      Each possible move is shown with a badge indicating its evaluation if played:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blue badge:</strong> best move according to ChessDB</li>
      <li><strong>Green badge:</strong> leads to a better position (positive score)</li>
      <li><strong>Red badge:</strong> leads to a worse position (negative score)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You’re seeing what would happen if a move is played — not the evaluation of the current position.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>Click to Explore the Best Line</h3>
    <p>
      Click the blue badge to follow the engine’s best line. Keep clicking to step through the entire variation — it’s a quick way to study high-quality play.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>Curated Games for Every Player</h3>
    <p>
      We selected 18 games for each player — a mix of famous, instructive, and diverse positions from all stages of their career. It’s a great way to learn, compare styles, or just enjoy brilliant chess.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>How Evaluations Are Queried</h3>
    <p>
      Most chess tools use a single method to query engine evaluations. ChessBest is different — it offers two:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Direct API Query:</strong> Fast, live data from the official ChessDB server</li>
      <li><strong>Proxy Fallback:</strong> Our own relay (used only if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This dual approach ensures both performance and reliability. You can choose your preferred method in the Settings panel — or let the app switch automatically if one fails.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="detail-block">
    <h3>Clickable Title Improvements</h3>
    <p>
      You can now click the game title to reload the last opened PGN and jump directly back to your current analysis point. If you branched earlier, clicking the title will return you to that branch point. Otherwise, it takes you to the last move you viewed, making it easier to revert or revisit your line.
    </p>
  </div>

	<div class="detail-block">
	  <h3>Click to Explore the Best Line</h3>
	  <p>
		Click the blue badge to follow the engine’s best line. Keep clicking to step through the entire variation — it’s a quick way to study high-quality play. When you branch out from the main game (for example, by clicking a blue “best move” badge), the point where you diverged is highlighted in orange in the move list for easy reference. If you want to return to the main game, just click the PGN game title at the top, and the board will jump back to where you left off.
